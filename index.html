				  Since September 2015, I'm a research associate at the SnT in
				  Luxembourg, working among other things on the verification
				  of distributed systems and on intuitionistic type theory.
				  Check
				  out <a href="http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/vincent_rahli">my
				    SnT webpage</a> for more information.

				  From January 2011 to July 2015, I was a postdoc and then a research associate in the
				  <a href="http://www.nuprl.org">PRL group</a> led by
				  Prof. Robert L. Constable, where I was using and working on
				  the foundations of the Nuprl proof assistant.  Here are some
				  of the projects we were working on:
				  The synthesis and verification of distributed
				  protocols specified in the Logic of Events, a logical
				  framework implemented in Nuprl to reason about event
				  orderings (message sequence diagrams).  We built
				  <a href="http://www.nuprl.org/software">EventML</a>,
				  a ML-like specification/programming language that cooperates with Nuprl to
				  specify, synthesize, and verify distributed protocols such as Paxos.
				  We were also
				  implementing <a href="http://www.nuprl.org/html/Nuprl2Coq">Nuprl's
				    PER semantics in Coq</a>.

				  <br/>
				  <br/>

				  From October 2006 to January 2011 I was a PhD student in
				  the <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/">School of
				    Mathematical and Computer Sciences</a>
				  at <a href="http://www.hw.ac.uk/">Heriot-Watt University in
				    Edinburgh</a>.
				  My supervisors were
				  <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fairouz/">Professor
				    Fairouz Kamareddine</a>
				  and <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/">Doctor J. B. Wells</a> of
				  the <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/">ULTRA</a>
				  group.
