Here's a non-exhaustive list of projects I would be interested in supervising.


					</br></br>

                                        <h3>Formalization of programming languages</h3>
					  <p>

I'm interested in projects related to formalizing programming
languages. For example, As part of our formalization of
<a href="https://github.com/vrahli/NuprlInCoq">Nuprl in Coq</a>, we
have formalized Nuprl's programming language in Coq. I would, among
other things, be interested in extending this language with new
features, or to formalize other kinds of programming languages.

					  </p>

                                        <h3>Formalization of logical theories</h3>
					  <p>

I'm interested in projects related to formalizing of logical
theories. For example, As part of our formalization of
<a href="https://github.com/vrahli/NuprlInCoq">Nuprl in Coq</a>, we
have formalized Nuprl's type theory in Coq; and as part of our
formalization of
<a href="https://github.com/LS-Lab/Coq-dL">KeYmaera in Coq</a>, we
have formalized its core in Coq. I would, among other things, be
interested in extending these theories with new features, or to
formalize other kinds of logical systems.

					  </p>

                                        <h3>Implementation of distributed systems</h3>
					  <p>

Fault-tolerant distributed systems such as PBFT are nowadays heavily
used in blockchain infrastructures (see
our <a href="articles/asphalion.pdf">Asphalion</a> paper for
pointers). There are many proof-of-concepts that have been discussed
in the literature, but that have never been fully implemented, and
that are typically lacking important features such as state transfer
or group membership changes. I'm interested in exploring such systems
and extending them with features such as the ones discussed above.

					  </p>

                                        <h3>Verification of distributed systems</h3>
					  <p>

In addition to implementing these distributed system, I'm interested
in verifying their correctness, for example using
our  <a href="articles/asphalion.pdf">Asphalion</a> tool.

					  </p>

                                        <h3>Management of distributed systems</h3>
					  <p>

In order to implement distributed systems, one typically needs to
implement some message passing infrastructure.  I'm interested in
building modular, configurable, and lightweight message passing
infrastructures that make it easy to deploy distributed systems.

					  </p>

                                        <h3>Blockchain systems</h3>
					  <p>

Byzantine fault-tolerant systems are more and more used in blockchain
systems.  However, they typically need to be adapted to fit the needs
of those systems.  I'm interested in supervising projects that aim at
designing such tailored solutions.
