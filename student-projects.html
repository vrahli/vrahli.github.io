Here's a non-exhaustive list of projects I would be interested in
supervising.  Click the titles below to expand the sections.

<button class="collapsible"><h3>Implementation and/or formalization of programming languages</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

I'm interested in projects related to implementing and/or formalizing
programming languages.

For example, distributed systems are notoriously hard to implement and
get right. Projects related to this could be:
<ul class="np">
  <li> designing domain specific languages (DSL) to help implement distributed systems can help ease this task </li>
  <li> a related project could be the formalization of such DSLs </li>
</ul>

As another example, the <a href="https://nuprl.org/">Nuprl</a> theorem
prover is both a programming language and a framework to formally
prove mathematical results.  It is however lacking, among other
things, a modern interface and a compiler.  Projects related to this,
could be to
<ul>
  <li> implement a modern interface for Nuprl </li>
  <li> implement an interpreter for Nuprl </li>
  <li> implement a compiler for Nuprl</li>
  <li> implement extensions of Nuprl, for example with side effects</li>
</ul>

We have
formalized <a href="https://github.com/vrahli/NuprlInCoq">Nuprl in
Coq</a>, which is another theorem prover, and have verified some of
its properties. Related projects can be for exampple:
<ul>
  <li> extend Nuprl and its formalization with new features</li>
  <li> formalize other kinds of programming languages </li>
</ul>

<button class="collapsible"><h3>Formalization of logical theories</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

I'm interested in projects related to formalizing of logical
theories. For example, As part of our formalization of
<a href="https://github.com/vrahli/NuprlInCoq">Nuprl in Coq</a>, we
have formalized Nuprl's type theory in Coq; and as part of our
formalization of
<a href="https://github.com/LS-Lab/Coq-dL">KeYmaera in Coq</a>, we
have formalized its core in Coq. I would, among other things, be
interested in extending these theories with new features, or to
formalize other kinds of logical systems.

<button class="collapsible"><h3>Implementation of distributed systems</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

Fault-tolerant distributed systems such as PBFT are nowadays heavily
used in blockchain infrastructures (see
our <a href="articles/asphalion.pdf">Asphalion</a> paper for
pointers). There are many proof-of-concepts that have been discussed
in the literature, but that have never been fully implemented, and
that are typically lacking important features such as state transfer
or group membership changes. I'm interested in exploring such systems
and extending them with features such as the ones discussed above.
For example, one could implement
<ul class="np">
  <li> <a href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~bessani/publications/tc11-minimal.pdf">MinBFT</a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://vrahli.github.io/articles/AtomicRTBCast.pdf">Pistis</a></li>
</ul>

</br></br>

<button class="collapsible"><h3>Verification of distributed systems</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

In addition to implementing these distributed system, I'm interested
in verifying their correctness, for example using
our  <a href="articles/asphalion.pdf">Asphalion</a> tool.

<button class="collapsible"><h3>Management of distributed systems</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

In order to implement distributed systems, one typically needs to
implement some message passing infrastructure.  I'm interested in
building modular, configurable, and lightweight message passing
infrastructures that make it easy to deploy distributed systems.

</p>
</div>
</br></br>


<button class="collapsible"><h3>Blockchain systems</h3></button>
<div class="content">
<p>

Byzantine fault-tolerant systems are more and more used in blockchain
systems.  However, they typically need to be adapted to fit the needs
of those systems.  I'm interested in supervising projects that aim at
designing such tailored solutions.
