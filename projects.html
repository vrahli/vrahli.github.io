					<h3>Certified theorem proving (Nuprl in Coq)</h3>

					<p>Allen's Partial Equivalence Relation (PER) semantics provides a
					semantics for Nuprl's type theory that allows one to prove that
					Nuprl's inference rules are valid, and therefore that Nuprl is
					consistent.  Until recently, these proofs were done by hand.  In
					order to formally prove that these rules are correct (and therefore
					that Nuprl is consistent), we have implemented this PER semantics
					using the Coq proof assistant.  This implementation (1) provides <a href=""></a>
					bridge between Nuprl and Coq, and (2) is the basis for developing <a href=""></a>
					certified version of Nuprl.</p>

					<h3>Certified theorem proving (KeYmaera X in Coq)</h3>

					<p>KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for cyber-physical systems (modeled
					as hybrid systems) that implements a logic called Differential
					Dynamic Logic (dL for short).  KeYmaera X has a small core thanks a
					uniform substitution based proof calculus.  We have implemented and
					verified this core in Coq.  This was joint work
					with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bbohrer/">Brandon
					  Bohrer</a> and <a href="http://symbolaris.com/">Andre
					  Platzer</a> from CMU, who have implemented and verified
					KeYmaera's core in Isabelle.</p>

					<h3>Intuitionistic and Nominal Type Theory</h3>

					<p>Using our formalization of Nuprl in Coq, we are turning Nuprl into an
					intuitionistic type theory, i.e., we have proved that some
					versions of Brouwer's continuity and bar induction principles are valid
					w.r.t. Nuprl's PER semantics.  In order to prove the validity of such
					continuity principles we have turned Nuprl into a nominal type theory.
					It remains open whether stronger continuity and bar induction rules
					are also valid.</p>

					<h3>EventML</h3>

					<p>EventML is a ML-like constructive
					specification language that implements a paradigm for verified
					programming.  It gives precedence to the programming task, and also
					allows programmers to cooperate with a proof assistant in order to
					structure arguments of correctness.
					It is designed specifically to cooperate with the Nuprl proof
					assistant in order to develop correct-by-construction asynchronous
					protocols.</p>

					<h3>Synthesis and verification of distributed protocols</h3>

					<p>Using EventML, we have specified, synthesized, and
					verified safety properties of the Multi-Paxos protocol.
					To do so,
					we have automated some patterns of reasoning;
					and to get efficient code, we have built a process
					optimizer in Nuprl.
					We are reusing this methodology to develop other
					provably correct protocols, striving towards more resilient and
					trustworthy systems.
					One of our current goal is to verify Byzantine fault tolerant
					protocols written in C using, among other things, the Verified
					Software Toolchain (VST).</p>

					<h3>Skalpel</h3>

					<p>Programming languages
					such as SML
					have sophisticated, flexible and
					safe type systems.
					Unfortunately, the type error messages for incorrect programs are confusing.
					Skalpel implements a promising approach to making type errors easier to understand and
					fix called type error slicing, in which slices (program points)
					containing all and only the information needed by the programmer to
					understand and fix a type error are identified and
					exhibited.
					Check out <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/ultra/skalpel/">the
					  web page of our project</a> where you can download
					packages for Debian and Red-Hat-based systems as well as
					  a web demo.</p>

					<h3>Semantics of expansion</h3>

					<p>Intersection types
					introduce type polymorphism in a finitary way.  Expansion was
					introduced to recover the principal typing property
					in such systems.
					The study of realisability semantics for such systems
					with expansion
					might help casting some light on the expansion mechanism.</p>

					<h3>Reducibility proofs</h3>

					<p>Reducibility is a
					  method based on realisability semantics
					  where the idea is to interpret types by sets of &lambda;-terms
					  closed under some properties.
					  This method
					  seems promising in generalising diverse properties' proofs of the
					  (typed or untyped) &lambda;-calculus.</p>
